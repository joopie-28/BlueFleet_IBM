# 1. Introduction

<p align="justify">
The blue fleet refers to a community of neustonic (i.e. drifting or floating with winds and currents) organisms, with a cosmopolitan distribution (Bourg *et al*., 2022). The community consists of several species of Cnidaria (Jellyfish and relatives) as well as a variety of Molluscs (Helm, 2021). Aggregations of these organisms may cover extremely large areas, sometimes spanning several kilometers. Whilst large fleets are generally confined to offshore areas, such as oceanic gyres, strong onshore winds and currents can cause mass strandings of these creatures (Bourg *et al*., 2022). This poses a risk to swimmers and beachgoers, as several constituent species possess the ability to envenomate people or animals upon touch (e.g. the Bluebottle). The exact dynamics driving stranding of harmful species are not completely understood, however this is an area of active research (e.g. Bourg *et al*., 2022; Lee *et al*., 2021). Interestingly, there is some variability in the number of species that one might find during a mass stranding event: sometimes we see all species strand, whilst at other times only one species may be recorded (Grove, 2010). This could be explained by the inherent morphological differences between the species that make up the blue fleet. For example, several cnidarians, including the bluebottle and the by-the-wind sailor (*Vellela vellela*), have evolved an enlarged membrane filled with gas that serves as a sail. Individual bluebottles come in a right or left-sailed orientation: these two morphotypes will drift in opposite directions from each other (Bourg *et al*., 2022; Lee *et al*., 2021). Other functional groups, such as the pelagic slugs that prey on the floating cnidarians, lack such structures. Thus, whilst all these species are considered part of the blue fleet, physical forces might affect them in different ways.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Here, we simulate the drifting dynamics of two species that are part of the blue fleet: The bluebottle *Physalia physalis* (Cnidaria: Siphonophora) and The 'Blue Dragon' *Glaucus atlanticus* (Gastropoda: Nudibranchia), a pelagic sea slug and a predator of *P. physalis*. Drifting behaviour, and associated beaching probabilities for each species were investigated through the use of an Individual Based Model (IBM). We incorporate meaningful ecological interactions between the two species, such as predation, to promote realism of the drifting dynamics. Not much is known about how Blue Dragons find their prey. However, it is possible that they are capable of very limited directed movement, as well as chemodetection of nearby prey using specialised structures known as rhinophores (Valdes & Compillo, 2004). Helm (2021) found that different species of pelagic slugs had distinct unique predatory preferences and behaviours when exposed to prey in a laboratory environment. Alternatively, prey density might be so high that Blue Dragons simply rely on chance encounters with prey. By simulating this system with different combinations of prey densities and biophysical parameters, we aim to generate insights into how a small neustonic predator finds prey. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
We thus strive to answer the following questions:

1. *How do beaching probabilities differ between the two species?*

2. *How do prey density, swimming speed and chemodetection affect the ability of a Blue Dragon to find prey?*
</p>

# 2. Model Elaboration

## 2.1 Conceptual Overview
<p align="justify">
The model is designed to investigate the effects of physical factors such as wind and ocean currents on the movement and behavior of the two species. We created a 50km x 10km grid, with a spatial resolution of 1 meter (5*10^9 total cells). Cells with x-values > 1km were assigned a 'land' status and all other cells where assigned an 'ocean' status. This resulted in a straight coastline stretching the left side of the grid, emulating the Eastern Australian Coastline. Each individual cell was then assigned a value for the following physical parameters: Wind Speed, Wind Direction, Current Speed, Current Direction. The temporal resolution was 1 hour. Thus, all speed parameters are in km/H, and each iteration represents 1 hour in real-time.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The environment was then populated with individual Glaucus and Physalia, each with their own unique attributes. For glaucus, we assigned the following attributes: initial X coordinate, initial Y coordinate, chemodetection range, and movement speed. As both chemodetection and speed are traits that are expected to vary between Glaucus, these were assigned by drawing one value from a normal distribution with mean = LITERATURE and sd = LITERATURE. Individual Glaucus could end up beached or alive at the end of the simulation. For Physalia, the following attributes were assigned: initial X coordinate, initial Y coordinate and orientation. Orientation refers to the position of the sail relative to the tentacles: this comes in a 'right-handed' or 'left-handed' variation. This variable was assigned randomly for each individual. Individual physalia could end up beached, eaten, or alive at the end of the simulation.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Whilst grid resolution was 1m, our model allows individuals to move through continuous space. The movement of an individual depends on the winds and current within the current cell, however the effect of these drivers might only amount to a movement of 20 cm within a timestep. This value is used to update the position of the individual. On the next iteration, the individual will simply 'feel' the same physical drivers, as it still finds itself in the same cell. This enables us to include the biological interactions that occur on the scale of centimeters.

### 2.2.1 Glaucus atlanticus
$$
X_{j,i+1} = X_{ij} + WindSpeed_{{xy,i}} * sin(WindDirection_{xy,i}) + CurrentSpeed_{xy,i} * sin(CurrentDirection_{xy,i}) + C * (GlaucusSpeed_{ij} * sin(atan(Y_{Prey} - Y_i, X_{Prey} - X_i)))
$$
$$
Y_{j,i+1} = Y_{ij} + WindSpeed_{{xy,i}} * cos(WindDirection_{xy,i}) + CurrentSpeed_{xy,i} * cos(CurrentDirection_{xy,i}) + C * (GlaucusSpeed_{ij} * cos(atan(Y_{Prey} - Y_{ij}, X_{Prey} - X_{ij} )) )
$$
***Where:*** 

$$
X_{j,i+1} = \text{Position}\,\text{along}\,\text{the}\,\text{East-West}\,\text{Axis for}\,Individual_{j }\text{ at}\,\text{Time = }\,i+1 \\
X_{ij} = \text{Position}\,\text{along}\,\text{the}\,\text{East-West}\,\text{Axis for}\,Individual_{j }\text{ at}\,\text{Time = }\,i \\
Y_{j,i+1} = \text{Position}\,\text{along}\,\text{the}\,\text{North-South}\,\text{Axis for}\,Individual_{j }\text{ at}\,\text{Time = }\,i+1 \\
Y_{ij} = \text{Position}\,\text{along}\,\text{the}\,\text{North-South}\,\text{Axis for}\,Individual_{j }\text{ at}\,\text{Time = }\,i \\
WindSpeed_{xy,i} = \text{Wind Speed}\,\text{in}\, cell_{X_i,Y_i},\text{at}\,\text{Time = }\,i \\
WindDirection_{xy,i} = \text{Wind Direction}\,\text{in}\, cell_{X_i,Y_i},\text{at}\,\text{Time = }\,i \\
CurrentSpeed_{xy,i} = \text{Current Speed}\,\text{in}\, cell_{X_i,Y_i},\text{at}\,\text{Time = }\,i \\

GlaucusSpeed_{i,j} = \text{Swimming Speed}\,\text{for}\, Individual_{j }\text{ at}\,\text{Time = }\,i \\
Y_{prey} = \text{Y coordinate of closest prey for}\, Individual_{j } \text{ at Time = } i \\
X_{prey} = \text{X coordinate of closest prey for}\, Individual_{j } \text{ at Time = } i \\
Prey = ∀Physalia \\
C = \begin{cases}
1, & \text{if Prey within } Detection Range_j \\
0, & \text{if Prey beyond } Detection Range_j
\end{cases}
$$

<p align="justify">
The movement of Glaucus atlanticus depends on physical and biological parameters. For iteration i of the model, the position of an individual is given by the x and y coordinate. The displacement between time = i and time = i + 1 is given by above equations. The effects of winds and current depend on i) the speed in km/h and ii) the direction in radians. Sin(direction) then gives vertical (north-south) displacement, whilst cos(direction) gives horizontal (east-west). To illustrate, if wind is blowing from the east, direction equals 1.5 * pi. Displacement can then be calculated as:
</p>

$$
\Delta_{x} = sin(1.5 * pi) * speed = -1*speed \\
\Delta_{y} = cos(1.5*pi) = 0 \\
\text{Thus, wind from the east will move an individual to the west}
$$

<p align="justify">
In addition, we allow Glaucus to make small directed movements towards prey, if their prey is within a certain 'detection zone'. The size of this detection zone depends on the chemodetection abilities of an individual glaucus. If a prey item is within the zone, we calculate the angle in radians between the predator and the prey, and multiply this new direction by the speed of that particular glaucus. The glaucus will always move to the closest prey item it detects.

Physalia moves at ~2.66% the speed of the wind (REF). Left-sailed individuals will be pushed in a direction 50 degrees to the left of the prevailing wind, whilst right handed individuals move 50 degrees to the right of prevailing winds. The effect of currents on physalia is described using the same equations as for Glaucus.

### 2.3 Biological Interactions
<p align="justify">
Both Physalia and Glaucus are allowed to interact with each other in our model, and this affects their movements. Glaucus will seek out nearby physalia as described in section 2.2.1. However, they may also 'latch' on to a physalia. This emulates feeding behaviour in which Glaucus move within the tentacles of a physalia: Glaucus may then move with the physalia, until it stops feeding or completely depletes the resource. Consequently, the time it takes to deplete the resource equals the time it takes for a Physalia to be killed. We assume that an individual physalia cannot survive unlimited attacks by Glaucus, and thus an individual that spends more than REF X hours 'under attack' will be assigned the status 'EATEN' and no further movements are simulated. Any Glaucus that was 'latched on' to the deceased prey, or one that simply stops feeding, then reverts to their regular movement equations. A glaucus may also detach from prey before consuming it. We model this using a beta prime distribution (size params 24 and 5), by letting the probability of detaching equal the probability of observing a given latch time from the specified beta prime distribution.
